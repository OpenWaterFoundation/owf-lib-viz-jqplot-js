# owf-lib-viz-jqplot-js
Open Water Foundation JavaScript visualization library based on jqplot

## Getting Started

A standard development folder structure is recommended. The website development files can be set up as follows (Windows is assumed, but Linux would be similar):

```
> C:
> cd \Users\user
> mkdir jqPlot-jS
> cd jqPlot-JS
> mkdir git-repos
> cd git-repos
> git clone https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-lib-viz-jqplot-js.git
```
The repository contains multiple folders that include time series examples using different sets of data.

Timeseries - examples graphing time series data
* TSTool-Large-Data-Example - example of graph for > 15,000 data points
* TSTool-Small-Data-Example - example of graph for < 150 data points
